# A very weird way to contact
Sir,

First of all **apologies for contacting in such a way**. But I wasn't able to contact you through Twitter & LinkedIn. Your email wasn't also available anywhere.

I am a Junior at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I was looking through CVPR 2020 publications when I came across your paper **“Learning to Evaluate Perception Models using Planner-Centric Metrics”**. My thoughts along with summary & annotations of the paper can be found [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OIlaXWWp3gZKJlrUDJDXLVKxyPW75T9I/view). I also loved your latest publication on emergent road rules. I have been searching on formal verification methods for enforcing traffic rules in multiagent motion planning. But it was a happy surprise to see the opposite being done. I loved how simple traffic rules came out as optimal solutions to the planning problems. I was thoroughly intruiged by the work being done & would love to contribute to the same in any manner possible.

I **would appreciate a chance to talk with you** about your research & possible future work on the same which I would **love to pursue for a remote internship** & possibly a Bachelor Thesis. It would be great if we could have a 15-min interaction.

My previous work experiences include:

1. **OpenReview Journal submission** on the reproducibility of the CVPR publication "FDA: Fourier Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation".
2. Motion planning & perception Team member for the **2019 Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition Runners-up** Eklavya 7.0.
3. Implementing motion planners on actual test vehicles (Mahindra e2o) as part of the **Mahindra Rise Challenge**.
4. Planning & Perception team lead for the **Indy Autonomous Challenge**. The challenge consists of making a modified Dallara IL-15 fit for **Autonomous F-1 Racing**.
5. Optimisation of an agent-based Simulator under Prof. Partha Pratim Chakrabarti.

I once again apologise for invading your privacy in such a manner. But I hope you can see my dilemma in contacting you.

I have attached links to my [**resume**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E_VBggc9K2Uu2o5nA_KKWF-0q9nvnq28/view?usp=sharing) and [**unofficial transcript**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yfyhm76WFF2XUkH3ZNNoal_lLtLi-rqV/view?usp=sharing) for your reference. Please let me know if there is any further information required on my part. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
